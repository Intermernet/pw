{"name":"pw","tagline":"pw is a Go library for password authentication","body":"pw is a Go library for password authentication\r\n\r\nIt attempts to put into practice the methodology described in [CrackStation's \"Salted Password\r\nHashing - Doing it Right\".][1]\r\n\r\nIt uses scrypt for key stretching, and assumes the use of an HMAC key for extra security.\r\n\r\nThe HMAC Key should be provided from somewhere outside of the database which stores the user IDs,\r\nhashes and salts. It should, at least, be stored in a secure file on the server, but it's \r\nrecommended to use an external server, or service, to provide the HMAC key.\r\n\r\nThe generated hashes are 256 bits in length, as are any generated salts.\r\n\r\nThe input HMAC key and password are only limited in length by the underlying Go crypto libraries.\r\n\r\nDocumentation available at http://godoc.org/github.com/Intermernet/pw\r\n\r\n[1]: http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm","google":"UA-41203083-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
